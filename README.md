# Victor Mentee Robotics project

## Code is in the following two files: "my_robot_brain_cpp_logic/src/main.cpp", "main.py"

## Run instruction:
1). run "pip install ./my_robot_brain_cpp_logic"

2). execute main.py with path to configuration yaml (e.g: "python main.py ./brain_configuration.yaml")

# Current sample output:

# Things I could have done better, but skipped due to time constraints preferences:

1). Object oriented implementation in c++ (have a single brain class with methods, instead of functions.)

2). Better variable naming and conventions.

3). Have the python main.py install the c++ file automaticly. 

4). Divide the c++ code into multiple files, instead of having all of the code in a single file.
